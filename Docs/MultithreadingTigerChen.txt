1. Single process with multi-threading (Assumption is that machine has one core)
    1. Thread-A handle DB action
    2. Thread-B handle UI operation, then UI does not freeze
    3. A and B let OS does schedule work makes UI works and DB works happen concurrently.

2. Multiple CPU (16 CPU with 32 cores)
    1. copy 100000 file with sequential process takes 32 seconds.
    2. Run with Multi-threading at number of 32, each thread bind with one core takes only 1 sec

3. 多线程时序图
